# Problem

Exercises 15.1-3<br>
Consider a modification of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a price p<sub>i</sub> for each rod, each cut incurs a fixed cost of c. The revenue associated with a solution is now the sum of the prices of the pieces minus the costs of making the cuts. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to solve this modified problem.

# Solution

```go
Cut_Rod(n) //input: p[], c  Aux: r[]
    for i = 1 to n
        q = p[i]
        for j = 1 to i/2
            q = max(q, r[j] + r[i - j] - c)
        r[i] = q
    return r[n]
```
