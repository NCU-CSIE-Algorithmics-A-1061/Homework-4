# Problem

Exercises 15.1-2<br>
Show, by means of a counterexample, that the following "greedy" strategy does not always determine an optimal way to cut rods. Define the **density** of a rod of length i to be p<sub>i</sub> / i, that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of length n cuts off a first piece of length i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, having maximum density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of length n - i.

# Solution

Consider a rod of length 3

| i | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| p<sub>i</sub> / i | 1 | 5 | 4 |
| p<sub>i</sub> | 1 | 10 | 12 |

11 (Greedy: 1, 2) < 12 (Optimal: 3)
